        <h2> Helathy food</h2>
        <article>
          Many foods enter the market with their producers claiming the foods have extraordinary health benefits. Touted as “superfoods,” some of these foods are costly, unusual mixes of phytochemicals packaged on the shelves of health food stores. The truly super
          health foods, however, are fruits, vegetables, grains and other naturally occurring foods. The National Institutes of Health Office of Research services lists fruits like kiwis, tomatoes, avocados, berries and apples; vegetables like leafy greens;
          fish, yogurt and tea as super health foods because they promote health benefits over and beyond being a good source of nutrients. For example, kiwis pack more vitamin C than oranges in less than 100 calories, and contain vitamin E, a rarity
          for fruits, so their antioxidant power can help you stave off diseases like cancer, dementia and fatty liver.

        <h2> Fast food</h2>
        <article>
          Fast food in America is a $183 billion dollar enterprise, according to IBIS World. Several decades ago, few Americans thought of fast food as a meal, as opposed to an occasional treat. Busy schedules coupled with the unmatched convenience of fast food,
          however, means that fast food restaurants are serving more Americans breakfast, lunch and dinner than ever before. Researchers reporting findings from the 2005 CARDIA clinical study say that Americans’ fast food habits are detrimental to health.
          Even with their healthier offerings becoming more common, the typical burger-fry-soda combinations are associated with weight gain and insulin resistance. Publishing in the January 2005 issue of “The Lancet,” University of Minnesota researchers
          said fast food consumption is increasing American’s risk of obesity and Type 2 diabetes.
